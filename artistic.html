<h3>Fully Express Yourself</h3>
<p>Generally an artistic shoot consists of choosing an artsy location i.e. Milwaukee, Third Ward area, or beach areas. Typically at these shoots, clients are looking for modeling pictures for social media. Other times, clients request photo shoots for a sport or activity they are interested in. These shots are mostly action shots - poses. Sometimes clients want a photo shoot using a specific prop. I have done a shoot with a client who wanted to use flour and this made for some super cool shots! Creativity is endless with artistic photos, I am open to all ideas! </p>
