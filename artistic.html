<h3>Fully Express Yourself</h3>
<p>Generally an artistic shoot consists of choosing an artsy location i.e. Milwaukee third ward area, or beach area. Typically at these shoots clients are looking for modeling pictures for social media. Other times clients want photoshoots for a sport or activity they are interested in. These shots are mainly action shots i.e. dance poses, tricks for a specific activity. Sometimes clients want a photoshoot using a specific prop. I have done a shoot with a girl who wanted to use flour, this made for some super cool shots! Creativity is endless with artistic photos, I am open to all ideas! </p>
